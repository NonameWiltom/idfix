# IdFix : Directory Synchronization Error Remediation Tool

IdFix is used to perform discovery and remediation of identity objects and their attributes in an on-premises Active Directory environment in preparation for migration to Azure Active Directory. IdFix is intended for the Active Directory administrators responsible for directory synchronization with Azure Active Directory.

The purpose of IdFix is to reduce the time involved in remediating the Active Directory errors reported by Azure AD Connect. Our focus is on enabling the customer to accomplish the task in a simple expedient fashion without relying upon subject matter experts. 

The Microsoft Office 365 IdFix tool provides the customer with the ability to identify and remediate object errors in their Active Directory in preparation for deployment to Azure Active Directory or Office 365. They will then be able to successfully synchronize users, contacts, and groups from the on-premises Active Directory into Azure Active Directory.
